echo /Here is an instruction on how to create a server and put bots on it:

echo /Make sure you have the port 27015 accessible for connections.
echo /How? Look here.

echo /Open the game console.

echo /How? Options⇨Keyboard⇨Advanced...⇨Enable developer console. Press ~ / ` to open the console at any time.
echo /Optional Type sv_lan 0 if you want the game to be public, or sv_lan 1 for LAN only.
echo /Public server is recommended

echo /Type map <mapname>, replacing <mapname> with the name of the map you want to play.

echo /Or press the [+] to the right of BROWSE SERVERS in main menu instead.

echo /Optional If the server is public and you don't want anyone to intrude, you can set a password:
echo /Type sv_password <pass>, replacing <pass> with some simple password.
echo /(e.g. sv_password 1234)

echo /Set the bot difficulty: tf_bot_difficulty <x>, where <x> is from 0 (the easiest) to 3.
echo /(e.g. tf_bot_difficulty 0)

echo /Add bots: tf_bot_add <team> <class>
echo /<team>: red | blue
echo /<class>: scout | soldier | pyro | demoman | heavyweapons | engineer | medic | sniper | spy
echo /(e.g. tf_bot_add blue heavyweapons)

echo /To remove all bots: tf_bot_kick all

echo /Here are some ways for your friend to connect. If one fails, try the next one.
echo /
echo /Join the game via Steam.
echo /In Steam Friends list press ▼ and Join Game.
echo /
echo /In console: connect <ip>:27015, where <ip> is your (server's) IP address.
echo /(e.g. connect 11.22.33.44:27015)

echo /Try the same thing with your (server's) local IP address (find it in Windows/Linux)
echo /If nothing works, see the step 1 of server creation instruction.
